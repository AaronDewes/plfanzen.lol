      <h1>Declaration of war against fanzen.pl*</h1>
      <p>
        We, the plfanzen team, hereby declare war on fanzen.pl. This site is an
        evil attempt to take over the plfanzen brand and we will not stand for
        it. We will fight back with all our might and we will not rest until we
        have defeated this evil.
        <br />
        We will not let fanzen.pl tarnish the good name of plfanzen. We will
        not let them take our brand and use it for their own nefarious purposes.
        <br />
        We will fight until the end and we will not give up. We will not let them win. 
        <br /><br />
